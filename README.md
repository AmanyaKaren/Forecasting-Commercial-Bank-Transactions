<h1 style="text-align:left; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times, serif; font-weight: bold;">Overview</h1>
The general objective is to develop a model that will successfully forecast cash transactions that will help NCBA Bank maintain a sufficient cash at its specifc branches.

<h1 style="text-align:left; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times, serif; font-weight: bold;">Research Questions</h1>
1) Is there predictability in the net cash transactions?
2) During which periods should the bank expect high cash outflows and when should they expect high cash inflows or a combination of both?
3) What is the a common occurence in the closing cash balances (many lows or many highs)?

<h1 style="text-align:left; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times, serif; font-weight: bold;">Success Criteria</h1>
The following metrics will be used to determine the project's success:
1) Ability of our analysis to provide the bank with actionable insights on the nature of their cash transactions that they can use for better planning cost cutting measures and security needs identification.
2) The final model's accuracy in forecasting future cash balances.

The data used in this project is from data world. The data consists of demo bank transaction details(debits and credits) carried out by different customers and includes other details such as the amount, the mode of transaction(either cash, RTGS, EFT, SWIFT e.t.c), the account's balance at the time of the transation, the time of the transaction e.t.c

<h1 style="text-align:left; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times, serif; font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</h1>
__Findings__

1) Seasonality in cash transactions - we observed spikes in cash withdrawals at the end of the year and in the mid -year around June.A high volume of cash credits is also observed in the mid and end of year periods(June and Decemeber)
2) There are more instances where the cash withdrawals outweighed the cash balances - indicating that the bank frequently requested for extra cash to cover heavy withdrawals.
3) There was no observed correlation between a particular day of the week and the net cash balance.
4) Cash balances were highest in December and February and lowest in January, June and July
